**Lawnicons reFilled** is a fork of [Lawnicons](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnicons), an icon pack developed by the [Lawnchair team](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher). This fork replaces the icons with their old pre `1.0.0` filled variations.

Lawnicons reFilled is best used [on Lawnchair 12.1 or Lawnchair 14 Beta 2](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair/releases). You can enable themed icons on Lawnchair by going to `Home Settings → General → Icon Style → Themed Icons → "Home screen" or "Home screen and App Drawer"`.

## About this fork
> [!NOTE]  
> Lawnicons currently has around 5000 icons. This fork only contains 200.

Some time before the first official release of Lawnicons, the then around 200 (mostly) filled icons were [replaced by redesigned outlined versions](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnicons/commit/4c38e06ff5c373bf06d4f2daedebeace7c967d57).
This greatly improved the consistency of the icon pack, but personally, I wasn't a big fan of the new design language. After the old version of Lawnicons I was using stopped working, I created this fork to ensure compatibility with newer releases of Lawnchair.

This fork is the current version of Lawnicons (`2.9.0`), but with the old pre `1.0.0` filled icons. 
The `legacy` branch contains the last official (pre-release) version of Lawnicons before the redesign.

I currently have no plans to actively maintain this fork, and will only update it once it no longer works with the latest version of Lawnchair. I don't plan to add any new icons unless I need them for my own purposes. However, PRs for doing so are welcome.
